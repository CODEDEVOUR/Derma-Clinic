            <p>Hi there, we’re Mavis, and welcome to our privacy policy which also applies to our customers.
            This policy sets out how we handle your personal information if you’re an Mavis user or visitor to our site.

            <p>When we say ‘we’, ‘us’, or ‘Mavis’, it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the site.
            If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘user terms’ we’re talking about the
            rules for using the site. The rules vary by product; each product makes them Mavisrately available and seeks
            consent to them Mavisrately to this policy.</p>

            <h5 class="fw-bold">The Type Of Personal Information We Collect</h5>

            <h5 class="fw-bold">How We Use Personal Information</h5>
            <p>This data is intended to identify you as our customer subscriber and deliver products/information and other
            marketing elements. Visitors aren’t allowed to purchase any product or subscribe to the newsletter or make a
            comment anonymously. So, this information is the only means we can identify you and allow you to make these
            actions on the site.</p>

            in a secure location. Personal information that we store is protected by security and access controls,
            including username and password authentication, two-factor authentication, and data encryption where
            appropriate.</p>

            <h5 class="fw-bold">How You Can Access Your Personal Information</h5>
            <p>You can access some of the personal information we collect by logging in to your account. You also have the

            <h5 class="fw-bold">Marketing Choices Regarding Your Personal Information</h5>
            <p>Where we have your consent to do so (e.g., if you have subscribed to one of our email lists or have
            indicated that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us), we send you marketing
            communications by email about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. You can
            ‘opt-out’ of such communications if you prefer not to receive them in the future by using the “unsubscribe”
            facility provided in the communication.</p>

            and to comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to use your personal information or to
            provide you with the Mavis services, you can request that we erase your personal information and close your
            account.</p>

            <h5 class="fw-bold">When We Need To Update This Policy</h5>
            <p>We will need to change this policy from time to time to ensure it stays up to date with the latest legal
            requirements and any changes to our privacy management practices. When changing the policy, we will notify
            you about such changes; where required, a copy of the latest version of this policy will always be available
            page.</p>
